    "# XY-FZ35: electronic load in custom build housing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **XY-FZ35** is a small and very inexpensive electronic load with a maximum **load power of 35 W** and **load current of 5 A**. Unlike considerably more expensive devices with a wide range of functions, the XY-FZ35 offers \"Constant Current (CC)\" as its only function. Therefore, it is suitable, for example, to investigate both the performance and the response of various protection circuits of wall mounted power supply outputs, mobile power banks or conditioning batteries. \n",

    "Description:\n",
    "- **LVP:** (Low Voltage Protection) If the voltage drops below a set value then the load will turn itself off. This is important for discharge tests on batteries in order to protect the battery from deep discharge.\n",
    "- **OAH**: (Maximum Discharge Capacity) When the load is turned on it calculates the accumulated discharge capacity (in Ah) and turns itself off when a set value has been reached. This feature too is for protecting the battery when doing discharge tests.\n",
    "- **OHP**: (Maximum Discharge Time) When the discharge time reaches a set period of time than the load will turn itself off. Important for discharge tests.\n",
    "- **OVP**: (Over Voltage Protection) If the voltage is greater then a set value the load will turn itself off.\n",
    "- **OCP**: (Over Current Protection) If the current is greater then a set value the load will turn itself off.\n",
    "- **OPP**: (Over Power Protection) If the power it absorbes gets greater then a set value then the load will turn itself off.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">**Note:**</span> Some alarms (**OPP**, **OAH**, **OHP**) can't be cleared via serial communication. In those cases the On/Off Button on the device itself must be pressed to end the alarm and get the device operational again. Message Boxes will tell you if that's the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### S/F Replies (success/fail)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commands have a reply just `success` or `fail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fail usualy means wrong format or a value out of range. Especially the format is tricky - you need to send exact same decimal digits as required (including leading and ending zeros) and also **no line ending**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: `OPP:05.00` will work, but `OPP:5` or `OPP:5.0` or `OPP:05.00<CR><LF>` will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:green\">**Note:**</span> My FZ35 returns in success case `sucess` (sic). But [ah01](https://github.com/ah01/fz35/blob/master/communication.md) stated that there are some implementations of communication library that respond `success` with correct spelling. So maybe there are some more FW versions out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters reply\n",
    "\n",
    "For `read` command the device will reply with current setting in following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OVP:xx.x, OCP:x.xx, OPP:xx.xx, LVP:xx.x,OAH:x.xxx,OHP:xx:xx<CR><LF>\n",
